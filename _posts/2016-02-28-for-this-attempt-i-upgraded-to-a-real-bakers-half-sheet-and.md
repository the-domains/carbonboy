title: 'For this attempt I upgraded to a real Baker’s Half Sheet and a fairly massive Baking Stone to simulate a bakeries’ brick oven. Both helped.The problem is that I am getting a really crusty crust, but still slightly too doughy of a texture in the roll itself. I’d still like to get a bit more rise out of the dough as well. Taste was near perfect!'

HINT: the bacon cheeseburger pictured here will kill you prematurely, but it was soooo good that I didn't mind the consequence!
