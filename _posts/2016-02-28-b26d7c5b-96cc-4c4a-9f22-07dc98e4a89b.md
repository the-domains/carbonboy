## [3rd Attempt at Recreating the Sheboygan Hard Roll][0]

For this attempt I upgraded to a real Baker's Half Sheet and a fairly
massive Baking Stone to simulate a bakeries' brick oven. Both helped.

The problem is that I am getting a really crusty crust, but still slightly too doughy of a texture in the roll itself. I'd still like to get a bit more rise out of the dough as well. Taste was near perfect!

Once I perfect the process with the limitations of a home oven, I 
will do the unthinkable: I will add some whole rye and wheat germ to up 
the fiber and lower the glycemic index -- to make it healthier and 
tastier -- all part of my devious master plan to create the perfect 
hamburger (that won't kill you prematurely).

HINT: the bacon cheeseburger pictured here will kill you prematurely, but it was soooo good that I didn't mind the consequence!
